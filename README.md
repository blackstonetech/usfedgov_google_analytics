US Fed Gov Google Analytics Drupal Module
=========================================

Embeds appropriate GA javascript file for US federal agencies

BETA RELEASE NOTES:

This module contains a submodule in the js folder that pulls in code from https://github.com/GSA/DAP-Gov-wide-GA-Code

To update the javascript files from the GSA repository above, make sure you clone this repo recursively.

To change the agency js file, you must select the file in the admin gui accessible at /admin/config/system/usfedgov_google_analytics. The .js files in the /js directory will dynamically populate the select list.
